This project was inspired while deadling with cameras freezing up during live broadcasts to maintain their health and issue port restarts when necessary on HP Procurve Switches. I'm please to offer this script to assist with any issues with devices that go dead on poe ports. It can be used beyond camereas.

We welcome any further development.

Project was developed by Alexis Ravencall and Thalia Montreux

We have a SystemD Service File
Code to Monitor Devices
and a example list for the program.

csv header is as follows
DeviceIP, DeviceName, MAC Address, Switch IP, Switch Port
